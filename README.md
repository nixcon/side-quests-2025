Any good game needs side quests in addition to the main story line[^1].

Various groups are organising smaller events in the space-time surrounding NixCon 2025.

If you're up for some additional adventures, check the [notice board](https://github.com/nixcon/side-quests-2025/issues) and talk to the respective NPCs[^2]!

We invite you to to create your own side quest by [posting it to the notice board](https://github.com/nixcon/side-quests-2025/issues/new). It's free!

[^1]: What was the main story line again, anyway?
